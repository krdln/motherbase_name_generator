#Mother Base Name Generator
A simple program to generate names like those assigned randomly to Mother Base staff members in Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain.

This is my first Rust program that actually does something.

If you want to alter the names that appear, just remove/add lines to `first_names.txt` and `last_names.txt`.

##Usage
```
cargo build
cargo run [ammount_of_desired_names]
```
